TO DO LIST




This is a to-do list implementation I made using ReactJS. You can see the live
application here:


https://roinitalucian.github.io/to-do-list/





It has the following features:

	- adding, editing and removing entries
	- sorting and filtering the entries by different criterias
	- automatic expiration if deadline is exceeded
	- local storage support
	- responsive design (kind of)
	- form validation
